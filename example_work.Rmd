# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

One of the reason I really enjoy teaching quantitative methods is because of the incredible work that our masters students can produce with just a few courses.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tibble(mtcars)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg,y=cyl))+geom_point()
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd

thing=["a","b","c","d","d"]

thing_frame=pd.DataFrame(thing)
thing_frame.value_counts()
```
